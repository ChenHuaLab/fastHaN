Compare the haplotye networks that constructed by fastHaN(v1.0) and McAN(v1.4.1)

1. Data
  50 SARS-CoV-2 samples in both PHYLIP (for fastHaN) and MUTATION (for McAN) format
  Note: McAN need an additional reference (usually empty), therefore, there are 51 samples in the MUTATION and META file

2. Software
  (1) fastHaN (v1.0): https://github.com/ChenHuaLab/fastHaN
  (2) McAN (v1.4.1): https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007301/releases/V1.4.1

3. Visualization
  (1) fastHaN: https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/haplotype/tcsbu (or use the local tcsBU software)
      input: Sample50.gml (generated by modified_tcs of fastHaN)
             Sample50_hapconf.csv and Sample50_groupconf.csv for country information

  (2) McAN: https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bit/hapnet/view
      input: haplotype_loci.json (generated with McAN)
