### Description of the SupplementaryFile2 ###


1. Data<br>
  1.1 Test50.phy.gz: the test data contains 50 samples<br>
  1.2 Test500.phy.gz: the test data contains 500 samples<br>


2. Test50
  * network constructed with MJN and TCS algorithms by fastHaN and PopART
  * sample size is 50

  field of the file names: [sample]_[software]_[algorithm].png
  eg. Test50_fastHaN_mjn.png: constructed with mjn algorithm of fastHaN


3. Test500
  * network constructed with MJN and TCS algorithms by fastHaN and PopART
  * sample size is 500
  * one or eight threads used for fastHaN

  3.1 graph file generated by fastHaN and PopART
  field of the file names: [sample]_[software]_[algorithm]_[thread].txt
  eg. Test500_fastHaN_mjn_thread1.txt: constructed with mjn algorithm of fastHaN in single-threaded mode.
  Note: PopART only processes data with single thread.
